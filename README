CARPY is a web app for comparing protein properties.
The database is compiled from SGD and high-throughput studies.
Comparisons are done using R, and the site is built on the Flask web framework.

CARPY is still in very early development, and is not functional at this time

To import a new database:
* Use vim to replace all instances of 'TRUE' with 1, 'FALSE' with 0, and 'NA' with ''
* run: mongoimport -d Carpy -c Proteins --drop --headerline db.csv

# To-do
* Ability to provide custom background list
* Sort enriched/deenriched properties by p-value
* Isotope sorting/filtering of enriched/deenriched properties
* About page (define terms)
