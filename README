CARPY is a web app for comparing protein properties.
The database is compiled from SGD and high-throughput studies.
Comparisons are done using R, and the site is built on the Flask web framework.

CARPY is currently in an alpha release

To import a new database:
* Use vim to replace all instances of 'TRUE' with 1, 'FALSE' with 0, and 'NA' with ''
* run: mongoimport -d Carpy -c Proteins --drop --headerline db.csv

# To-do
* About page
	- Define terms
	- Cite data sources
	- General instructions for use
* Fix sort order of "Rank of Multifunctionality", check other properties
* Flag non-independent/misleading properties
* Produce downloadable report of results
* Clean up JS in multi-protein view
	- Use embedded JSON representation of data
	- Get template logic out of JS (this is really ugly)
	- Move JS to external file
